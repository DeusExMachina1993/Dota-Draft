Dota-Draft: A Research-Ready Dataset for In-Game Recommendation

This repository contains the datasets and benchmark scripts introduced in the paper:

"Dataset Creation for In-Game Recommendation: A Dataset-Oriented Study" (2025)

Recommender systems have benefited greatly from standardized datasets such as MovieLens and Amazon Reviews. However, in-game recommendationâ€”particularly in complex, multi-agent environments like Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs)â€”lacks standardized benchmarks. This repository addresses this gap by providing the Dota-Draft dataset, designed for reproducible and extensible research in in-game recommendation.

ðŸ“– Overview

Domain Gap: Existing public game datasets focus primarily on recommending games to players, rather than supporting in-game decision-making.

Dataset Contribution: We release a research-ready dataset for hero drafting in Dota 2, capturing sequential pick/ban states, patch versions, and match outcomes.

Benchmark Integration: The dataset is preprocessed and packaged for the RecBole recommendation framework, enabling reproducible baseline evaluations.

Open Challenges: We highlight patch-driven dynamics, multi-agent synergy, and high-dimensional context as unique challenges for recommender systems in this domain.
